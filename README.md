# LangGraph Practice

This repository contains my **hands-on practice programs** while learning **LangGraph** through a structured playlist.
The goal of this repo is to understand how to build **stateful, multi-step, and agentic AI workflows** using LangGraph.

## What this repository covers

- LangGraph fundamentals (nodes, edges, state)
- Conditional and dynamic execution flows
- Single-agent and multi-agent workflows
- Tool calling and function execution
- Short-term and long-term memory handling
- RAG-based workflows using LangGraph
- Human-in-the-loop patterns

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangGraph**
- **LangChain**
- **Google Gemini API** (free-tier friendly)
- Vector Databases (Chroma / FAISS)
- FastAPI (in selected workflows)
